HackPrinceton 2017 Project: "Trashure Chest" (Android mobile application)

In order to minimize waste accumulation, this app allows users to upload photos of items they no longer want that others
can receive through email communication with the owners. Users can take pictures with their camera or upload pictures from 
the photo gallery, add labels and their contact info (hidden from the main screen), and add to the list of available items.
Keyword search is also enabled to help users find specific items or related items.

**Disclaimer: this app only works locally; data is not retained after the application stops.
